1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,980
Welcome back everyone and.

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,980
Due to popular demand
and bringing Fred back

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,190
after.

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:11,670
Our cancer interview there's so many
questions that video hit over a million views

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,010
and there's a lot of
questions so we want to

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,250
talk about.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:16,330
What

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,500
to eat.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,380
Once you get cancer now

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,190
there is a diet to prevent
cancer which you know i i i really

11
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,080
i think it's going
to be healthy keto

12
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,290
fasting but.

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,570
Once you get cancer what do you eat
so that's we're going to talk about today.

14
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,250
So welcome Fred.

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,980
I have thanks for
having me again.

16
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,690
Absolutely for those of you that haven't
seen the first video i'm going to put that

17
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,690
link down below.

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,020
But in a thumbnail sketch.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,370
And

20
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,020
you had a tumor.

21
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,280
That was

22
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,860
how large was it
fifteen centimeters.

23
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,190
Ten centimeters

24
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,680
ten centimeters okay.

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,100
In your Colin and
within four months.

26
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,830
Ah it shrank down to nothing so.

27
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,950
It was a stage three
borderline states for it was a.

28
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,680
Remarkable what you did and so

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,570
we want to talk about exactly the
details because there's so many questions.

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,810
Is that correct you've been
getting a lot of questions.

31
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,450
Yeah yeah absolutely
to the point that i couldn't

32
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,400
answer everyone
and i apologize if.

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,530
I had questions on my YouTube channel i
received email messages i tried to answer

34
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,380
everybody or as much as i
could underneath your video.

35
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,020
Please allow time so.

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,970
I'm really glad you invited me to a to a
question and answer so that's going to be

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,640
it's going to be
much easier for me.

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,310
Yes.

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,410
And just to make a disclaimer anything that
i say is not meant to diagnose or replace

40
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,830
your medical care check with your doctor
before implementing anything we're gonna

41
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,830
talk about.

42
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:45,496
And

43
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,490
we have no buy
them wants to sell you

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,820
and.

45
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:49,870
So.

46
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,720
That's my disclaimer.

47
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,460
And.

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,550
I want to just jump right in and a
really important part of this program is

49
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,790
fasting.

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,930
Twenty one day fast

51
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,170
so i guess the first question.

52
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,190
You know when you

53
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,040
when you tell someone they
have to fast for twenty one days.

54
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
That probably gonna.

55
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,590
Freak out

56
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,710
so.

57
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,080
How how is it possible that you
can fast for twenty one days i mean.

58
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,660
I mean aren't you going
to starve to death like what

59
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,470
how would you

60
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,820
respond to that question.

61
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,190
Well first

62
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,670
it's important to know
that i didn't jump into.

63
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,940
Into some guy nuff woo hoo e p.

64
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,860
Treatment.

65
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,890
I was followed by it by my oncologist
both in France and in the u s all the time

66
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,780
and i made my research

67
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,650
and you don't want to bet
my life on someone told me

68
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,110
well yeah you know you should
fast when you have cancer

69
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,780
so i read all the
scientific literature.

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,360
I rent all of doctor domestic friends or
research doctor wanted was the longest suit

71
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,360
your research

72
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,790
and at some point.

73
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,770
I discovered your video

74
00:02:59,070 --> 00:02:59,580
which

75
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,600
and i'm very i'm being very honest
with it's really really really helped me.

76
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,328
And but yeah i made
the research and the the

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,610
twenty one day.

78
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,180
Water fast.

79
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,850
Seems to be

80
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,280
some kind of a of a of a.

81
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,940
Perfect time

82
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,880
to to help with cancer.

83
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,470
And the

84
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,630
like we discussed
in the previous video.

85
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:22,530
And

86
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,830
i'm completely aware that i was
in the perfect condition to do that

87
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:30,360
and everybody needs to make his own research
to adapt to his own lifestyle level of

88
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
stress weight

89
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,670
talk to your doctor

90
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,580
does a lot of things i mean
don't just do what i did.

91
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,570
What i'm trying to do
huh and i talked to you

92
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,020
doctor burden unto
your enter your members

93
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,500
and is simply to share
my experience and tell you.

94
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,210
There is a possibility to do something
else or to add something to your treatment

95
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,780
there there's some research that you can
do that that's what i'm trying to do do.

96
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,230
And as far as the twenty
one day fast whites

97
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,400
it's very easy you
know you all know now

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,546
following dr berg's the
principle of pathology.

99
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,450
Which is basically when
you're healthy sales has nothing

100
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,800
have nothing to eat.

101
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,900
Instead of dying of hunger.

102
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,310
They will feed

103
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,690
on your non healthy

104
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,380
cells

105
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,570
so basically the
healthy cells will

106
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:12,960
will

107
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,500
eat

108
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,600
literally eat the cancer cells

109
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,850
and that's that's
the reason why.

110
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,880
Fasting is so powerful
when you have cancer

111
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
and that's what i did.

112
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,040
And.

113
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,610
Twenty one days not fun
and like i said the other day

114
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,150
if i were to do it today
i would probably fail

115
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,590
because i don't have.

116
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,290
The a good reason

117
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,810
to do it even though
fasting is always healthy

118
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,860
but when when someone tells you
you're probably going to die you know

119
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,470
and all the research seemed to.

120
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:47,100
Indicate that if you fast
this is not going to happen.

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,240
You just do it

122
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,570
you know it's not the
it's not even a question.

123
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,580
So that's why.

124
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
It was not.

125
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:55,920
That

126
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,730
hard

127
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
but was i weak

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
was i tired yes of course.

129
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,300
Did i spend most of
my twenty one days

130
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,830
lying down on my bed

131
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,310
yeah

132
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,150
absolutely.

133
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Did i lose weight

134
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,040
yeah.

135
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,400
That too.

136
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,640
Did i feel great no

137
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
absolutely not

138
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,560
but.

139
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,010
It worked.

140
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,980
After i had my first mri before
and on my second a mri after

141
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,270
the twenty one day fast

142
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,170
and the results were here that
schumer went from ten centimeters to five.

143
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,430
You know.

144
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:29,400
When you're dealing with
a life or death situation.

145
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,500
Mostly apple will do
whatever they can.

146
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,680
And it also requires fasting
and the thing about fasting

147
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,590
is what you guys need
to know as it's the most

148
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,560
important thing you can do
because of all the different.

149
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,170
Things that kick in

150
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,820
from a genetic level

151
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,390
to hormone level like the
growth hormones go down

152
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,200
and

153
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,550
the cancer cells.

154
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,640
Start committing
suicide because.

155
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,080
When you don't

156
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,800
eat your body goes in
this hyper survival mode.

157
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,430
And.

158
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,620
And it starts to survey vibe better and so
you get all the cancer genes that turn off

159
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:04,920
and then.

160
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,110
Your your cells actually

161
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,380
recycle.

162
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,680
The cancer cells for food.

163
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,160
So that's a great.

164
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:16,170
Great thing to be able to turn your cancer
cells into food for your normal cells that.

165
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:19,590
I mean there's just so much
research on this and i think.

166
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,250
It's important to.

167
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,050
Do.

168
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,040
Not just blindly follow
anyone to really get the data

169
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
study it

170
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,500
and unfortunately

171
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
there's a lot of big.

172
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,860
Terminal term new terms

173
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,411
when you read the research
so you're going to have to get.

174
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,340
Several dictionaries out you're going
to have to get a medical dictionary

175
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,160
and you're going to have to
understand some of these 'em.

176
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,910
The study so you can have
the confidence to know that.

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,810
You know

178
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,310
it can it can work for you.

179
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:49,020
And

180
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,220
you are you are so right when you say that
because one of the first thing that i did.

181
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,440
When i learned
that i had cancer.

182
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,510
Was to educate myself.

183
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,000
What is cancer what
do we know about it.

184
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
And the

185
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:03,690
one of the thing that i
always tell people is.

186
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,230
My shield from cancer
by trusting the science

187
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,520
and not the doctors.

188
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,630
And i'm not.

189
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,940
Throwing a stone at
the doctors not at all

190
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,450
but.

191
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,500
Not everybody's up to date
with the the latest research

192
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,180
and when you start reading.

193
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,160
Twenty twenty two
twenty twenty one.

194
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,180
Two thousand

195
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,530
all those latest

196
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,120
research on cancer and fasting and
cancer and a ketogenic diet and genser as a

197
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,290
metabolic disease.

198
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,870
You learn so much that.

199
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,010
You're.

200
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,740
Or at least my oncologist
didn't fill me up.

201
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:35,730
So.

202
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,690
Getting educated and taking
your health into your own hands.

203
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,660
Is the key to
whatever i did and that

204
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,650
the only thing that i
will recommend people.

205
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,570
Yeah i mean.

206
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,440
In a thumbnail sketch of the
way you solve problems is by.

207
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,940
Understanding.

208
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,530
The problem more.

209
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,990
That always seemed
to solve any problem i.

210
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,580
Okay so now

211
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
i.

212
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,760
Did you have you didn't really have a lot
of weight to lose when you did this right

213
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,960
so you did get skinny

214
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,540
and you went from
what weight to what way.

215
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,440
I went from seventy
kilos to forty nine kilos

216
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,040
okay.

217
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,210
So.

218
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,220
Sorry i don't know what it is in pounds
but basically i i went from a very healthy

219
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,220
and fit.

220
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,000
Body composition
to nothing but bones.

221
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,690
Okay.

222
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,370
As far as.

223
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,730
During the fasting period

224
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,150
and.

225
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,870
We're not oh let's not talk
about the supplements first but.

226
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,460
What about did you have

227
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,970
anything you had did you have
coffee you didn't you take water

228
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,700
was there anything juices
that you have anything

229
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,970
to eat.

230
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,340
So that's one of the.

231
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,380
Number one question and

232
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,400
i received

233
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,090
from.

234
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,320
From the people is what did you
eat during your twenty one day fast

235
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,850
and the answer is nothing.

236
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,530
It was nuts

237
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,400
it was not intermittent fasting and
people really have to make the difference.

238
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,960
It was not a juice
fast or a raw food fast.

239
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,290
It was a fast

240
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:04,350
period so i didn't eat anything

241
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,590
in twenty one days.

242
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,040
I mostly had water.

243
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,430
And i was supposed to drink.

244
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:13,590
One little shop

245
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,170
of wheatgrass
juice freshly pressed

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,030
wheatgrass juice every day

247
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,770
which i didn't because.

248
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,690
It tastes horrible.

249
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,830
Until

250
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,140
and here again
thank you dr berg.

251
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,520
Until i saw your video on the
your wheatgrass juice powder

252
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,070
which i bought immediately
unchanged my life

253
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,460
and

254
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,670
i'm not getting paid to say
that i have no personal interest

255
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,560
i'm just saying
because it's the truth

256
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,790
and from that moment it was much
easier for me to consume a little bit.

257
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,530
Of wheatgrass juice.

258
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,950
When i needed it.

259
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,310
So basically i dunno maybe

260
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,930
three four times a week.

261
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,400
I would have a little shot

262
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,810
of regress juice

263
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,580
and that was it so water

264
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,730
most of the time

265
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,340
and with pressed juice

266
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
once in a while.

267
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,550
That's all i had for
twenty one days.

268
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,900
Okay now let's shift to the supplements
because that's an important question.

269
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,250
For those of you that
are new watching this.

270
00:10:08,384 --> 00:10:09,384
I study.

271
00:10:09,644 --> 00:10:10,644
Myself.

272
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:11,784
Tighten the bomb

273
00:10:12,104 --> 00:10:15,944
and a lot of you viewers that
are watching right now donated to.

274
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:18,584
This cancer research
we did in Europe.

275
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:20,624
With the help of.

276
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,254
Maurice.

277
00:10:22,514 --> 00:10:24,284
Israel who is a professor

278
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:25,244
and

279
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:26,714
his his md.

280
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:30,584
And as a medical doc or as
well as his phd in biochemistry.

281
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,714
A very very smart.

282
00:10:33,344 --> 00:10:35,804
Person who helped
us set up this study.

283
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:38,474
He found some
fascinating fascinating

284
00:10:38,924 --> 00:10:39,464
and.

285
00:10:39,794 --> 00:10:40,794
Data it.

286
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:44,354
As far as the weak link of
cancer the achilles heel the

287
00:10:44,624 --> 00:10:45,624
the area where.

288
00:10:46,664 --> 00:10:50,414
It's a really big difference between
a cancer cell and a normal self and.

289
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:55,184
And without getting into any technical
things there's a there's a door that.

290
00:10:56,414 --> 00:10:58,334
Goes in the cancer that allows

291
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,374
the cancer cells to
make membranes.

292
00:11:01,108 --> 00:11:02,744
And without those membranes

293
00:11:02,853 --> 00:11:04,034
the cancer cell cannot.

294
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:05,594
Survive

295
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:08,294
and so this metabolic

296
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:09,534
enzyme.

297
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:10,734
Name.

298
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:12,014
The initials are Scott.

299
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:13,184
And so

300
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:13,994
if you could

301
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:16,124
potentially block this enzyme.

302
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:19,904
You could starve the
cancer not from fuel

303
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:21,614
but from.

304
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:22,364
Its

305
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:23,714
raw material

306
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:25,454
it's structure its membrane.

307
00:11:25,814 --> 00:11:26,814
So.

308
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:28,194
The problem is.

309
00:11:28,904 --> 00:11:29,904
Well.

310
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:31,244
Most came

311
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,884
not most but a
handful of chemo drugs.

312
00:11:34,214 --> 00:11:35,654
Then it could be most i dunno.

313
00:11:36,704 --> 00:11:36,794
I

314
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:38,264
actually block Scott.

315
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:43,184
But they also kill the cancer
and they kill your immune

316
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,494
system and it just
so happens even

317
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:47,024
a cancer cell itself.

318
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,414
Is and.

319
00:11:48,644 --> 00:11:51,554
Has some of your own
immune cells in the cancer

320
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:53,114
tumor itself or the

321
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:53,804
cancer.

322
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:55,604
So in other words 'em.

323
00:11:56,084 --> 00:12:00,464
We wanted to find a natural way to block
Scott without the t toxic effect destroying

324
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:01,464
your immune system.

325
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:02,144
Well

326
00:12:02,594 --> 00:12:03,594
and.

327
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:05,474
He did some.

328
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:08,594
Previous research and
he found great success

329
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:10,184
so what we did is we

330
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:10,484
do.

331
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:12,294
Did.

332
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:14,624
That research and
we compared it to.

333
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:15,644
One of the most

334
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:18,674
powerful chemo drugs
to see how it compared.

335
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:20,094
Andor.

336
00:12:20,924 --> 00:12:21,924
I did very well

337
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:23,294
i did a summary of that.

338
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:25,414
That steady I'll put
that link down below.

339
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,774
But anyway there are certain
nutrients that can block this enzyme

340
00:12:30,134 --> 00:12:30,734
to

341
00:12:30,974 --> 00:12:32,894
potentially close the door on.

342
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,144
The reproduction of the cancer.

343
00:12:35,594 --> 00:12:37,004
Cell and then you took.

344
00:12:37,484 --> 00:12:38,504
Like the two

345
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:39,884
the two big ones

346
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:41,534
are Alpha lipoic acid

347
00:12:41,984 --> 00:12:42,984
and a

348
00:12:43,034 --> 00:12:44,564
garcinia cambogia

349
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:47,324
so you sir tell us a
little bit about Tom

350
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,154
the supplements that you took.

351
00:12:49,604 --> 00:12:52,124
Cause i know there isn't a lot
of extra things you took as well.

352
00:12:52,754 --> 00:12:53,774
Yeah absolutely

353
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,074
and.

354
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:56,744
Please forgive me if i if i.

355
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:57,704
Use.

356
00:12:58,064 --> 00:12:58,574
A little

357
00:12:58,724 --> 00:12:59,724
of notes.

358
00:12:59,984 --> 00:13:01,944
Because i don't want to
forget any thing for your.

359
00:13:02,294 --> 00:13:03,294
For your followers.

360
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,984
All the things that i
that i put in my book.

361
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:10,994
Helps me with the timeline and remembering
what i did when he goes as you can imagine

362
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:11,414
i was.

363
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:12,924
My rain was.

364
00:13:13,274 --> 00:13:15,794
Pretty much frozen when
they told me i had cancer and

365
00:13:15,914 --> 00:13:16,154
and.

366
00:13:16,514 --> 00:13:16,874
I had

367
00:13:17,114 --> 00:13:17,504
big

368
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:18,704
chances to die.

369
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:20,124
So.

370
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:23,834
Sometimes i don't remember what i
did when it gets a little confusing so

371
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:25,964
i take my own book
and i and i take a look.

372
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:30,704
So basically yes what i did was the
twenty one day fast then strict ketogenic

373
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:31,484
diet

374
00:13:31,634 --> 00:13:33,014
one hundred percent organic

375
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:33,494
and

376
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:34,614
the supplements.

377
00:13:34,754 --> 00:13:38,864
So the supplements just to make sure i
don't forget anything i'm going to i'm going

378
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:41,384
to read my own book and
and take a look at it the view.

379
00:13:41,774 --> 00:13:42,774
If you allow me.

380
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:45,074
Man so basically
this is what i did.

381
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:46,244
I used.

382
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:47,684
Vitamin d three.

383
00:13:49,664 --> 00:13:50,664
Vitamin c.

384
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:52,644
Turmeric.

385
00:13:53,384 --> 00:13:54,384
Zinc.

386
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:56,384
Omega threes.

387
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,184
In the form of fish oil

388
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:00,224
and in the form of d h eight.

389
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:03,704
Then i also used.

390
00:14:04,064 --> 00:14:05,624
The famous and

391
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:06,834
metabolic.

392
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:08,984
Treatments that you
just mentioned from.

393
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:10,934
From professor moyes Israel.

394
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:13,724
Which is made of
Alpha-lipoic acid.

395
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,274
Garcinia Cambodia.

396
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:19,554
Garlic.

397
00:14:20,174 --> 00:14:21,464
Or garlic extract.

398
00:14:24,434 --> 00:14:25,434
What else but

399
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:26,566
bu.

400
00:14:26,654 --> 00:14:28,094
Oh yes and.

401
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:29,574
Melatonin.

402
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:30,704
Is a new one

403
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:35,924
high doses of Melatonin in my case it was
anywhere between twenty and thirty grams.

404
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:38,624
And.

405
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:39,924
Drama Lane.

406
00:14:41,204 --> 00:14:42,434
And i think that's about it.

407
00:14:42,944 --> 00:14:43,944
So.

408
00:14:44,294 --> 00:14:45,294
Much i hadn't.

409
00:14:45,434 --> 00:14:48,764
Yet got much a green
tea matcha green tea yeah

410
00:14:48,884 --> 00:14:50,924
okay so those are the
supplements that i used.

411
00:14:51,404 --> 00:14:53,444
Great and will put those
down in the description but

412
00:14:53,744 --> 00:14:55,454
but the the big thing that.

413
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,084
I wanted to sir

414
00:14:57,164 --> 00:14:58,694
just mentioned will briefly.

415
00:14:59,174 --> 00:15:00,174
Do.

416
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:02,294
Some of the like Melatonin.

417
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:03,864
Also.

418
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:05,264
Allison from the garlic.

419
00:15:05,774 --> 00:15:06,774
And.

420
00:15:06,944 --> 00:15:07,944
Are also

421
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:09,554
Scott inhibitors so

422
00:15:09,824 --> 00:15:10,574
there's actually

423
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:12,074
many Scott and Harrison

424
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,654
and that is the next
thing we're looking at is to.

425
00:15:14,984 --> 00:15:17,594
Take all these natural
Scott inhibitors and.

426
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,624
Evaluate which ones
are the strongest to the.

427
00:15:21,524 --> 00:15:22,574
The weakest and

428
00:15:22,874 --> 00:15:23,174
but.

429
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:24,944
You know at this point.

430
00:15:25,364 --> 00:15:27,164
We haven't done that
test so we're going to

431
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:28,124
include

432
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:29,984
quite a few of the inhibitors

433
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:31,724
and Melatonin is another.

434
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:33,684
Potent.

435
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:39,404
Compound for cancer and of
course so is garlic and so as green tea

436
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:40,674
green tea.

437
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:41,834
Also blocks.

438
00:15:42,764 --> 00:15:43,764
The.

439
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:45,644
Cancer from consuming.

440
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,004
Glutamine.

441
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:50,204
Which is very very awesome
but it does other things too so.

442
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:55,544
So in other words Maurice Israel looked
at the camera the the whole biochemistry of

443
00:15:55,544 --> 00:15:56,234
what happens

444
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:57,504
in cancer.

445
00:15:57,824 --> 00:16:02,234
And he really studied what things need
to be blocked in what we could use to help.

446
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:04,164
Block.

447
00:16:04,454 --> 00:16:07,814
From going the front and
the back and the back door

448
00:16:08,084 --> 00:16:11,084
i'm telling you these these
cancer cells are really sneaky

449
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:12,944
so you have to use strategies

450
00:16:13,424 --> 00:16:13,844
to.

451
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:16,574
Handle this problem
from all angles

452
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:17,814
so.

453
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,694
So you took these
natural remedies.

454
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:20,864
And

455
00:16:21,044 --> 00:16:22,044
you also

456
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:24,614
i think you add sea salt to
write because that's input rd

457
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:25,061
and

458
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:27,975
some of the other vitamins you
took because you're not eating food.

459
00:16:28,484 --> 00:16:30,734
You're going to have to
take these vitamins because.

460
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:32,534
Your health depends on it so.

461
00:16:32,954 --> 00:16:35,564
You didn't eat food but
you had nutrients which

462
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:38,954
are not going to break the fast and what
we're trying to do here because they're.

463
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:42,794
Providing something that you're
really missing when you're not eating.

464
00:16:43,964 --> 00:16:44,354
Yeah

465
00:16:44,474 --> 00:16:45,824
so on my side

466
00:16:45,944 --> 00:16:46,364
it was

467
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:47,174
it was a.

468
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:48,624
Hard decision.

469
00:16:48,944 --> 00:16:49,634
As to.

470
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,214
Do i take my supplements
when i'm fasting or not

471
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:52,964
and.

472
00:16:53,294 --> 00:16:54,294
I was gonna

473
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:57,194
and that's why i suggest
people do and guy

474
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:58,314
as you know did it

475
00:16:58,574 --> 00:17:00,914
but me my empty
stomach couldn't take.

476
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:03,614
The vitamins and mineral
supplements when i was fasting

477
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:05,234
so no i didn't take anything.

478
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:07,004
For the twenty one days

479
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:11,654
and i started supplementing after the fast
but it's not what i recommended because i

480
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,184
have a very sensitive stomach

481
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:14,894
and i just couldn't

482
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,354
i took one bite them in
with a little bit of water and

483
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:19,124
two minutes later
my stomach hurt.

484
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:21,464
But yeah usually.

485
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:22,364
Married

486
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:23,924
marries his royal anniston.

487
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:25,094
I

488
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,914
suggest that you keep
taking those supplements

489
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:28,514
as

490
00:17:28,634 --> 00:17:29,894
your fasting definitely.

491
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:33,134
The omega three fatty acids are.

492
00:17:33,524 --> 00:17:35,924
Composed of d h a
and e pa those are.

493
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,304
Fish oils and

494
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:40,364
those are really really
really important as well and.

495
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:42,464
Especially for.

496
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:44,084
Their anti cancer so

497
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,344
of course everything.

498
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:46,754
That you mentioned is.

499
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:47,564
Has

500
00:17:47,804 --> 00:17:52,904
other additional anti cancer properties like
the turmeric for example and rumbling so

501
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:53,774
and.

502
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:55,182
I think.

503
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:55,934
You you

504
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,814
you're just basically hitting it from a
lotta different angles because you did the

505
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,254
research and you found wow this.

506
00:18:00,644 --> 00:18:01,644
This could work.

507
00:18:02,324 --> 00:18:04,064
Yes absolutely so first.

508
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:06,224
My oncologist friend in Paris.

509
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,054
Who is aware of.

510
00:18:08,414 --> 00:18:10,544
Morrissey's around in
his work and at the time.

511
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:12,104
Lol Schwartz's work.

512
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:14,804
Told me okay Fred
you gotta start taking.

513
00:18:15,674 --> 00:18:17,864
Melatonin Melatonin right away

514
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:20,444
high doses of Melatonin
you have to start taking.

515
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:22,304
A green tea thinking.

516
00:18:22,814 --> 00:18:23,444
Garlic

517
00:18:23,564 --> 00:18:28,154
so he was aware of
the of the protocol which

518
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:28,514
was not as complete
as the time as it is now.

519
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,344
And then a little bit later.

520
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:31,704
I discovered read.

521
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:34,739
Through your channel
and and a common friend

522
00:18:34,844 --> 00:18:35,844
guy i.

523
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,164
Contacted him

524
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:41,024
and got the whole the full protocol
and that's that's how i continued.

525
00:18:41,444 --> 00:18:41,804
My.

526
00:18:42,344 --> 00:18:43,604
My treatment so to speak.

527
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:45,014
Okay.

528
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:46,994
So then when you

529
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:47,834
ate

530
00:18:48,014 --> 00:18:49,244
okay so you went twenty

531
00:18:49,544 --> 00:18:50,894
will first of all like how many.

532
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:55,634
You you had four months right so did you
start off with a twenty one day faster what

533
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:55,994
did you

534
00:18:56,204 --> 00:18:57,554
what type of fasting

535
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:01,484
and i think he was even for five days
not on the rican so just kind of explain.

536
00:19:01,994 --> 00:19:03,584
The details on that so so.

537
00:19:04,064 --> 00:19:05,354
When i was nine diagnosed.

538
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:09,794
I was really really down completely
frozen i couldn't make any decision

539
00:19:09,914 --> 00:19:12,344
just thinking i was going
to die for three days.

540
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:14,474
And after the three days

541
00:19:14,594 --> 00:19:16,694
i kicked myself in the
bud then i said okay.

542
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:19,994
I'm going to survive this i'm going to
do whatever it takes but i'm going to

543
00:19:19,994 --> 00:19:22,544
survivors and that's where
i started doing my research

544
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:24,704
so almost immediately i went

545
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,264
on a strict

546
00:19:26,444 --> 00:19:28,484
twenty one day fast water fast.

547
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:30,204
After that.

548
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:32,864
I went on a strict organic

549
00:19:33,074 --> 00:19:36,164
ketogenic diet then we can go
through what i ate if you want to.

550
00:19:36,674 --> 00:19:38,204
And for three months

551
00:19:38,624 --> 00:19:40,064
and almost at the end

552
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:44,204
i didn't know i was almost cure and the
time we just knew that the tumor was getting

553
00:19:44,204 --> 00:19:46,094
smaller and smaller
but he was still here.

554
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:48,194
I went for another

555
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:49,424
twenty one day fast

556
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:51,854
but only fasting
five days a week

557
00:19:52,154 --> 00:19:53,294
and eating normally

558
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:54,824
a normal ketogenic diet

559
00:19:55,064 --> 00:19:56,064
during the weekends.

560
00:19:56,624 --> 00:19:56,984
And so.

561
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,254
The goal that is so you started
with a twenty one day fast.

562
00:20:00,884 --> 00:20:02,174
Then you went to

563
00:20:02,294 --> 00:20:03,294
one meal a day

564
00:20:03,374 --> 00:20:04,544
and then you went back to.

565
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,634
A twenty one days
of really like five.

566
00:20:08,024 --> 00:20:11,354
Days of fasting and then
two days of one meal a day.

567
00:20:11,894 --> 00:20:13,454
Exactly the tone.

568
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:14,904
Okay yes.

569
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,770
And okay so then

570
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,480
when you did eat.

571
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,190
Coming off of the twenty
one day fast of course

572
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:24,520
you had to gradually
introduce food right.

573
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:25,510
Yes

574
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:26,252
so let's

575
00:20:26,354 --> 00:20:29,195
talk about what how did you gradually
injured his food what did you eat.

576
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,210
What first i was on a strict
ketogenic diet so zero zero carbs

577
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,070
or as close to zero as i could.

578
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,470
No sugar not even fruits

579
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
and.

580
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,540
Basically i was left with
proteins fats and veggies

581
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,890
so i tried

582
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,060
and i went on a.

583
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,170
On a on a quest almost discover
what can i eat and why couldn't

584
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,940
and most of what i ate.

585
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,020
Get me so much pain i was in so much
pain at the time because of the cancer.

586
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:01,570
So the only thing i could eat and i
discovered that throughout several days.

587
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,350
Was.

588
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,000
Freshly pressed

589
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,170
vegetable juice.

590
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Beef.

591
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,680
One hundred percent
grass fed grass finished beef

592
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,750
and mostly revise which.

593
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:17,950
For me was the perfect balance of
not too much protein and enough fat.

594
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,320
And good fats avocado.

595
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
Coconut oil.

596
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,320
Grass fed butter.

597
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,880
French heavy cream.

598
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,710
That's all i could eat it

599
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,140
sold for three and a half month

600
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,490
all i ate was.

601
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,900
Vegetable juice

602
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,340
and ribeye steak.

603
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,260
The next David devil juice and ribeye steak
and the day after that vegetable juice

604
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:40,030
and ribeye steaks
that's what i ate.

605
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:40,900
And.

606
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,800
Again or one of your video really
helped me because when i discovered

607
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,320
that glutamine could
also feed cancer.

608
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,300
In in in certain conditions.

609
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,940
But that green tea.

610
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,270
Could help her that's

611
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,470
what i did was.

612
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,580
Break my fast every day
with a fresh vegetable juice.

613
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Then.

614
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,338
About an hour later

615
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,350
had my steak and avocado

616
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,770
and about.

617
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,920
Five to ten minutes after that.

618
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,460
A big.

619
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,920
Glass of green tea

620
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,810
to help control roll

621
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,580
the glutamine from the stake

622
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,140
and that was my meal

623
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
every single day

624
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,720
for almost three months.

625
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,610
Okay.

626
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,160
Good so that helps out

627
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,790
and

628
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:23,270
and then.

629
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,986
As far as quantity of what you

630
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,920
did you just pretty
much eat enough.

631
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,630
So you can be filled

632
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,489
because your
stomach when fasting

633
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,270
kind of shrinks since you're not able to
probably the quantities that you normally.

634
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,470
Well.

635
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:37,780
I can eat

636
00:22:38,055 --> 00:22:39,880
the mother or that i can eat so

637
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,200
before cancer.

638
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,370
If i had

639
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:46,990
if i had pizza for example i wouldn't have
wanted i wouldn't have two bids as i have

640
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:47,680
for pizza

641
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
i can eat.

642
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,930
Of course i couldn't eat the same thing and
not in the same quantity when i was sick

643
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,170
but.

644
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,000
At least

645
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,150
a one pound

646
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,782
ribeye

647
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,950
it was my.

648
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,690
Basic

649
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,930
quantity.

650
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,910
Once a day.

651
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,140
Yet once a day.

652
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:06,460
A big glass of fresh
seasonal vegetables.

653
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,056
A big

654
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,780
one one pound
ribeye cooked in butter

655
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:13,420
or olive oil with a pinch in

656
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:13,750
a

657
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,020
Milan salt

658
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,220
or sea salt.

659
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
And migrant he.

660
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,300
Does basically
what i ate every day

661
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,660
and what to do what type
of i supposed to do juice.

662
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,100
Anything

663
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,220
anything that was

664
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,960
organic

665
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
and in season.

666
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,090
So

667
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:30,580
during the summer
i juiced a ladder for

668
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:33,850
a spinach and cabbage
and stuff like that.

669
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,570
During the winter.

670
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,660
When we went more into the
spring i just cucumbers and celery

671
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,970
so it really i just
took whatever.

672
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,000
The farmers market
was offering me.

673
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,560
At that particular time.

674
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,530
But as many veggies as possible

675
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,550
drains

676
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
colored.

677
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,710
To have as much micronutrients
as i could that was my goal

678
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,980
to really.

679
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:58,900
Push.

680
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,390
The micro nutrition into my body

681
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,940
and to help my body
fight that cancer.

682
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:09,130
There are so many things so many anti
cancer every time you look up the benefit of

683
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,770
any vegetable even beets
and carrots and everything.

684
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,920
It they will always say
to them any accident has.

685
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,060
It

686
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,180
has anti-inflammatory
anti cancer.

687
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,570
Properties.

688
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,270
But i think also you had

689
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,370
a cruciferous vegetables too right oh
yes glorious a lot of a lot of broccoli is

690
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,190
and the two have
even more effect

691
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,340
i used a lot

692
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,430
i juiced a lot of
broccoli sprouts.

693
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,420
So.

694
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,750
I put the sprouts

695
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:36,910
in neiges

696
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,500
in the in the juicer i'm in.

697
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,420
And the just extract

698
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,400
the nutrients from
the broccoli sprouts

699
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,720
and yeah

700
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,870
that was.

701
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,370
Mainly.

702
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,810
All my juices.

703
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,800
All my juices in addition
to the seasonal vegetable

704
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:52,120
i always added

705
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,420
broccoli sprouts

706
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,520
and turmeric

707
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,110
those are the two
things that were

708
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,940
that were here in NY juice.

709
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,500
Year round all the time.

710
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,900
That's powerful
powerful anti cancer

711
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:02,710
and.

712
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,300
Like now.

713
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:05,530
Going

714
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,280
now

715
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,120
present

716
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
to present time

717
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:09,820
what do you normally eat now.

718
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,810
So i tried to stay on
a one meal a day.

719
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,700
Intermittent fasting protocol

720
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,910
but not always

721
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,320
if i work out a lot or just if i'm
hungry I'll have two meals a day.

722
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:21,040
In it.

723
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,900
In a six hour window

724
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,080
so i still spend a lot of
the day and night of course

725
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,200
fasting.

726
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,780
And as far as food.

727
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,230
Now.

728
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,440
I can have pretty much
any kind of proteins.

729
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:33,520
And

730
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,180
eggs

731
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:35,330
no problem.

732
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,710
Chicken.

733
00:25:36,897 --> 00:25:37,897
Fish.

734
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Beef of course.

735
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,800
So and any kind of
animal protein is fine.

736
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,390
I'm still having a hard time with
whole veggies because the fibers.

737
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
Still.

738
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:48,760
Irritates

739
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,280
my my investments
so i still juice my that

740
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:51,640
is.

741
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,590
The main difference.

742
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,160
Is the sugar.

743
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,390
So.

744
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,040
I eat.

745
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,810
A little bit of sugar

746
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,160
in the form of fruits

747
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:01,870
and once in a while

748
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,730
in the form of raw honey.

749
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:04,840
And.

750
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,530
It is something that i didn't
allow myself at all when i was sick.

751
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:11,980
I am not convinced one
hundred per cent that.

752
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,700
The fructose the
sugar of the fruits.

753
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,660
In it's original foot
mattress which is the whole

754
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,350
truth.

755
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,930
Is really bad for cancer i dunno

756
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,580
but because i didn't know.

757
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,380
I preferred not had

758
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,480
any sugar at all when i was sick

759
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,430
but not in a not sick anymore and i have
zero trace of cancer than older cancer and

760
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,050
inflammatory markers are good.

761
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
I have fruits.

762
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,520
On my non workout days

763
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:42,040
so on my workout days i do more.

764
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,227
Of the

765
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,380
proteins and fats

766
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,030
and on my non

767
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
workout days

768
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,050
i do less fat and
a little bit the fruits.

769
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,490
Of course

770
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,960
organic and seasonal

771
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,540
so that's the main difference
with what i didn't before

772
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,880
so my diet is
basically the same.

773
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,040
As far as micronutrients.

774
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,010
A little bit more
variety with the proteins

775
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,450
and a little bit of fruits.

776
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,010
Three times a week.

777
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,360
Got it.

778
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,356
Do you.

779
00:27:08,825 --> 00:27:09,004
Do

780
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:11,920
you currently take any
probiotics were from

781
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,480
fermented type foods.

782
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,600
Yes i use a Sauerkraut

783
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:17,870
a lot.

784
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:18,700
A lot.

785
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,440
A little bit of Sauerkraut.

786
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,790
Almost every day.

787
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,330
So that's so key for your your
gut in the mic since you had.

788
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,920
It was in your digestive system so might
as well support that and that you couldn't

789
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,540
get a better food
than Sauerkraut.

790
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,430
Yeah Sauerkraut is
really one of the thing

791
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:39,760
that's not on the i
like so it's not it's not.

792
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,010
An effort for me to eat it

793
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,550
and and it's soup for
super powerful as far as as

794
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:48,550
a pro and prebiotics
so i'm amusing it's.

795
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:49,450
Quite

796
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
often.

797
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,980
Fantastic.

798
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,100
Now i want to bring up another
really really important point and

799
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,820
so if anyone checked
out check back in right

800
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,180
now because this
part is really important.

801
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,680
Before you got cancer
and your diet wasn't that bad

802
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,800
in fact you're.

803
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:07,420
Doing it

804
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,830
fasting you you're doing.

805
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,480
Keto

806
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,580
the healthy version
for a period of time.

807
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:14,080
Wish.

808
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,410
It was.

809
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:17,380
I asked you a question.

810
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,590
What was your stress level and
your stress was off the roof and

811
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,520
and so.

812
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:22,910
When you do with.

813
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,720
Cancer and.

814
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,550
There are things in a smoking can
cause cancer chemicals cause cancer.

815
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:31,970
Chronic.

816
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,850
Anything can cause.

817
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,210
Cancer

818
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,600
and bad foods
and things like that.

819
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
But.

820
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,030
People don't really.

821
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,650
Put all attention on
the stress factor too so

822
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,230
a stress factor can activate.

823
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:49,420
Your genetics to.

824
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,920
Turn things in.

825
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,340
A bad way you

826
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,620
can turn things on that

827
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,380
should be turned off so you
went through stress that i think.

828
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,570
Because of the whole
pandemic thing you

829
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,050
couldn't.

830
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,310
You couldn't have your

831
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:00,880
you had

832
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,750
different doge jazz around the
country that closed down right.

833
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,560
Yes.

834
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,240
Yes absolutely and and

835
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
went.

836
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,850
There's a lot of different stresses and
and that's what people don't understand.

837
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I didn't have

838
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:17,500
what most people would
call a very stressful life

839
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,060
i mean i didn't battle

840
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:19,690
with

841
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,390
my family i didn't
battle at work i didn't

842
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,340
i didn't have
that kind of stress

843
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,330
and.

844
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,300
Your rights when you said
at my life i was pretty good.

845
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,090
I tried to eat
organic for the past.

846
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,410
I dunno twenty

847
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,560
twenty five years.

848
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:36,520
I was on keto for
quite a long time.

849
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,660
What else always active

850
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,080
and doing a lot of
meditation are a lot of tai chi.

851
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,780
My martial arts boxing parkour

852
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,900
crossfit

853
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,510
so as i was an active person.

854
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,620
And

855
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,750
doing intermittent
fasting for twenty years.

856
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:53,650
And.

857
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,200
So people asked me so how come

858
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:58,270
you did all that and got cancer

859
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,790
and you did all
that and get cured.

860
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:01,660
And.

861
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:02,980
I think

862
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:06,006
i'm not sure but i think it's
the compounding of everything

863
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,720
it's putting everything together

864
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,900
all the time.

865
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,140
And as face trust.

866
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:12,940
Yes

867
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:13,596
the

868
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
dependent make.

869
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,520
And and the the world
situation stops me from doing

870
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,200
a big part of my

871
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,350
professional activity.

872
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:26,260
I usually travel the world to to go and
teach in all my nitro Joe's around the world

873
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,530
night

874
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,700
my martial arts goals

875
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,970
i couldn't do that.

876
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,900
It's complicated as far as.

877
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,550
Finance.

878
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,300
And of course that
was a big stressor.

879
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:39,130
And thats when

880
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,330
the cancer appeared

881
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,410
i also had

882
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,310
a genetic predisposition because
apparently from what the doctor told me.

883
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,250
It was one of the few real

884
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
genetic.

885
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:50,410
Cancer

886
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,500
so my food and my
lifestyle was not so much.

887
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,620
The the the guilty parties there

888
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,110
but to my genetic background was

889
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:01,360
the sleeping cause as i call it

890
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
but distress

891
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,550
was the trigger

892
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,020
that there's no doubt yeah.

893
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,320
And i try my best when i
was trying to heal myself

894
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,940
to compound everything that i knew about
fasting and diet and stuff like that plus

895
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,170
all my new research.

896
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:15,620
Was with.

897
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:19,780
Even less stress in my life
you know more breathing more.

898
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,090
Walking out in nature more.

899
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,940
Meditation and stuff
like that then i think it's a

900
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,130
it's a combination
of all the things.

901
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,190
We said last time
on the last video that.

902
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,560
Cancer is multifactorial

903
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,300
but healing cancer

904
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:37,120
is also multifactorial
and i did a lot of things.

905
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,150
If you add to everything
that we talked about

906
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,800
the ice cold bath.

907
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
The breathing

908
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,190
and the walk in nature.

909
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:49,450
Playing with my dog playing
with my wife having fun laughing.

910
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,090
Watching it nothing
but comedies.

911
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,290
All those things.

912
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,770
I believe participated
to my healing.

913
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,390
You know.

914
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,770
He brought up a good point like you
had to you have to step up your discipline

915
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,130
to to.

916
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,650
To get an ice cold ass i mean for example
fasting for twenty one days that's all

917
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,970
requires a lot of discipline

918
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
and you know.

919
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,960
I think come out of necessity.

920
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,610
You understanding.

921
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,060
What needs to be done because
now you did the research.

922
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,250
Out of necessity you pulled it out of yourself
and you're able to kind of stick to it

923
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,800
because you're probably
willing to do whatever it took.

924
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,260
To survive basically

925
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:29,920
yes

926
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,120
yes absolutely

927
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
and the.

928
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,520
Some people say abbott is probably because
of your martial arts training you have

929
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,840
more discipline than others.

930
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
It might be true

931
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,400
but look at gaia

932
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,630
our friend guy

933
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,280
who is.

934
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,600
Who was seventy

935
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,160
at the time of his cancer

936
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:45,880
and

937
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,360
no discipline whatsoever
never breakfast any martial arts.

938
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,110
Overweight

939
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,480
cancer stage four

940
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,160
and diabetes

941
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,870
everything you
could have he had it

942
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,290
and he did the same thing

943
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,950
as me he did the fat
thing he did the keto

944
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,000
and and

945
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,290
he cured himself

946
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,560
so.

947
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,770
Like you said out of necessity

948
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,160
when your life is on the line
i think it's much much easier

949
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:09,940
than when

950
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,660
you just.

951
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,200
Randomly decide to do a
fast or randomly decide to

952
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:14,920
to

953
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,500
as as as a prevention to
take care of your health.

954
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,500
And don't get me wrong
prevention is critical

955
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,830
and it's much better much
easier than finding a cancer

956
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
but.

957
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:25,780
But

958
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,590
it's harder

959
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,090
it's hot too fast.

960
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,660
When.

961
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,820
When you don't have.

962
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,410
A.

963
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,180
Very very high motivation
such as eight you're gonna die.

964
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,310
You know

965
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,420
people that are watching
this video right now are.

966
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,360
Either potentially have cancer.

967
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:46,870
They're interested in
preventing cancer that

968
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,350
might have friends or
family that have cancer

969
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,650
but if cancer is
not on your radar.

970
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,270
Because you're not.

971
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,250
You don't have
any awareness of it

972
00:33:54,495 --> 00:33:57,016
it'll never happen to me even
though it's the number one second.

973
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,150
Or the second.

974
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:58,809
Killer

975
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:00,050
world.

976
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,610
And.

977
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,030
You probably won't be
interested in cancer until you.

978
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:07,930
Have you to someone
close to you or yourself

979
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,016
can you start developing
cancer and then.

980
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,750
You become very
interested in it.

981
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,500
So.

982
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:15,250
It wasn't i wasn't into health

983
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,320
at all until i had probably my

984
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,580
late twenties.

985
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:22,180
Because i personally was
affected negatively with my health

986
00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:23,450
other people

987
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,120
they seemed to
get by and they can.

988
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,840
They don't have any problems until
later in life and then they they make this

989
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,370
shift and change.

990
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:31,480
So.

991
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,280
My whole thing is awesome.

992
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
You can.

993
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,180
Acquire

994
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,590
a tremendous amount of

995
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,400
survival knowledge by
learning from other people's.

996
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,910
Stories.

997
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,850
Others people's success

998
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,730
successful actions other
people's strategies and.

999
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,330
I dunno if.

1000
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,360
When you're watching
this you realize how.

1001
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,310
Vital

1002
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,630
and Fred is

1003
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,560
giving us this

1004
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:00,490
this really key is these keys
are these strategies because.

1005
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:03,850
It can come in handy if
you have your kid cancer.

1006
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,511
Wherever you have someone
going through cancer this is like.

1007
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,160
Superior information
that you should.

1008
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,270
Use

1009
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,010
and apply and think with

1010
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
and.

1011
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,070
Cause there's nothing worse than getting
cancer and not having any of this data could

1012
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,070
you imagine like.

1013
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
Getting cancer

1014
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,600
not having all these insights

1015
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,400
and you just falling mainstream.

1016
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,330
Which

1017
00:35:25,497 --> 00:35:28,000
you're you know you pray i
dunno if you'd be alive by now.

1018
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:28,930
Yet

1019
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,830
absolutely

1020
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,110
and you know
we're so lucky to live.

1021
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,890
In the times we're living
because imagine my situation

1022
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,300
without the Internet

1023
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
a right.

1024
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:38,862
Right

1025
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,600
what would i have
done i mean nothing.

1026
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,350
Right.

1027
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,460
Right.

1028
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,740
That's right so.

1029
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,500
So again it comes down to.

1030
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,720
Being able to.

1031
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:52,000
Somehow with your awareness.

1032
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,460
Pull out the right
information that makes

1033
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,580
sense to you because there's
so much confusion out there

1034
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,710
and unfortunately

1035
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,100
and.

1036
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,440
The first

1037
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,840
five to ten pages of Google has.

1038
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,470
What the what
everyone's doing and i

1039
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,620
i think with the thing that
helped me mostly as a

1040
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,850
i'm always skeptical of what everyone
else is doing or everyone thinks is true.

1041
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,860
It's usually the opposite.

1042
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,580
Especially when you get into the
single everyone knows yeah well

1043
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,920
who's everyone and
where did that come from so.

1044
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,780
I suspect that i.

1045
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,140
I tend to do.

1046
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,700
Everything the opposite and
it seems to be very successful.

1047
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,510
Very successful.

1048
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,210
I remember

1049
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,790
i think it was one of your
videos when you said you have.

1050
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,990
I don't remember what he was i think it was
about diabetes if you have diabetes go on

1051
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,770
the website of the American diabetes
association and do the complete opposite then

1052
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,770
you have a better chance.

1053
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,060
I apologize if it's someone
else i don't remember

1054
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,650
but i thought that was brilliant

1055
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,840
and that's basically what i did

1056
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,390
he doesn't mean that
i completely rejected.

1057
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Western medicine

1058
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:00,460
or that i have a grudge
against against it.

1059
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:03,340
I just didn't think it
was the answer for me

1060
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,090
but

1061
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,740
as we discussed last time

1062
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,250
i

1063
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:06,940
i did.

1064
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,560
Three sessions of chemo.

1065
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,430
Because of the pain and it
really helped me so i'm thankful

1066
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,990
to to those doctors

1067
00:37:14,152 --> 00:37:14,258
and

1068
00:37:14,396 --> 00:37:14,860
nurse.

1069
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,490
Who who are helping with the
symptoms and it is critical when you.

1070
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:21,250
When you soft when
you suffer so much that.

1071
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,120
You don't

1072
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,220
you're not even sure
that you want to leave.

1073
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,440
And thats where i
was at some point.

1074
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,450
And a doctor tells you hair.

1075
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:32,080
Take my chemo take my feeling you're
going to feel better in in three weeks.

1076
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,310
It's a miracle

1077
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:37,690
and i and i really appreciated
and i thank my doctor for that

1078
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,440
but.

1079
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,360
As far as curing me

1080
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,490
without any long
term side effects.

1081
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,850
For me.

1082
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:48,550
Western medicine was not the answer
and i choose to look at the biology

1083
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,440
and the and the and the science

1084
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,820
instead of the medicine

1085
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,990
but he doesn't mean it's the same truth for
anyone everybody has to make his research

1086
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
and and put.

1087
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,420
His or her trust.

1088
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,250
Into what feels right

1089
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,110
for for for that person.

1090
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,040
When you deal with cancer
there's a lot of conflicting

1091
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,480
information so you have.

1092
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,320
A lot of

1093
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,000
so called facts that are

1094
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,040
opposing each
other you can't have.

1095
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,280
Two facts opposing each
other one of them has to be.

1096
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,210
False

1097
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,570
and so you you unfortunately
going to have to study both

1098
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:20,870
viewpoints.

1099
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,210
Back and forth to really see which
one is true and which ones are false but

1100
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:28,150
when you deal with cancer
there's a lot of money going on

1101
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,250
and there's a lot of corruption.

1102
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:31,840
There's a lot of them.

1103
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:36,010
False information
manipulation of research.

1104
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,370
So.

1105
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,680
There's a.

1106
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,900
There's a really good book
i'm gonna put a down below

1107
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,010
of them.

1108
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,960
Some one really

1109
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,330
highly credible scientists who.

1110
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,230
Talked about all the manipulation that
they do in cancer research and i think.

1111
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,820
If you're

1112
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
really.

1113
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,510
Interested you should take
a look at that book because

1114
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,810
you need to know

1115
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,640
the truth

1116
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
and.

1117
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,490
And that way you can em.

1118
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,630
You know not be susceptible
to doing the wrong thing.

1119
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,370
One of the thing that i did when i
was doing my research and it's.

1120
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,740
Just it was my main philosophy.

1121
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:16,210
It's not always true but i was my
main line to select information is

1122
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:17,830
when you have two conflicting

1123
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:20,140
informations about
the exact same thing.

1124
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,340
First.

1125
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,260
Trust the one that
doesn't make money.

1126
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,310
Like you're fasting.

1127
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,640
Trusting doesn't make
anyone any money

1128
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,250
so studied at first it
doesn't mean it's the truth.

1129
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,640
Keep studying.

1130
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,890
All possibilities

1131
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,720
but my first attention

1132
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,310
would be on those.

1133
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:40,600
Research and from researchers
that didn't make money out of it.

1134
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,210
That was my first to
my first main idea.

1135
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,070
Yet unfortunately others

1136
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,220
researches.

1137
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,640
They get paid they're
they're funded by

1138
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
industry and.

1139
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,790
Governments and
things like that so

1140
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,370
i mean who's going to
pay a researcher to do.

1141
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,360
Research on somebody
doesn't make money it's it's

1142
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,530
it's hard to.

1143
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,120
There's so many things like

1144
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,491
that is why you're not going
to find a lot of research in.

1145
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,060
Apple cider vinegar for example
because some it's just not.

1146
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,190
Not a product that people buy.

1147
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,490
So anyway Fred this
has been an incredible.

1148
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:15,530
Knowledge.

1149
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:17,110
Talk.

1150
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,782
Dialogue that we had i think
people are going to really.

1151
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,960
Use this data to
survive better and.

1152
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,750
I'll put some down some
links if he hadn't saw.

1153
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,650
If he had

1154
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:31,030
not seen the other videos that we've done
are related to this topic so you can have

1155
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,110
all information so.

1156
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,300
Thank you very much read.

1157
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,100
I appreciate you my pleasure

1158
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,370
thank you.
