Welcome back everyone and.

Due to popular demand
and bringing Fred back

after.

Our cancer interview there's so many
questions that video hit over a million views

and there's a lot of
questions so we want to

talk about.

What

to eat.

Once you get cancer now

there is a diet to prevent
cancer which you know i i i really

i think it's going
to be healthy keto

fasting but.

Once you get cancer what do you eat
so that's we're going to talk about today.

So welcome Fred.

I have thanks for
having me again.

Absolutely for those of you that haven't
seen the first video i'm going to put that

link down below.

But in a thumbnail sketch.

And

you had a tumor.

That was

how large was it
fifteen centimeters.

Ten centimeters

ten centimeters okay.

In your Colin and
within four months.

Ah it shrank down to nothing so.

It was a stage three
borderline states for it was a.

Remarkable what you did and so

we want to talk about exactly the
details because there's so many questions.

Is that correct you've been
getting a lot of questions.

Yeah yeah absolutely
to the point that i couldn't

answer everyone
and i apologize if.

I had questions on my YouTube channel i
received email messages i tried to answer

everybody or as much as i
could underneath your video.

Please allow time so.

I'm really glad you invited me to a to a
question and answer so that's going to be

it's going to be
much easier for me.

Yes.

And just to make a disclaimer anything that
i say is not meant to diagnose or replace

your medical care check with your doctor
before implementing anything we're gonna

talk about.

And

we have no buy
them wants to sell you

and.

So.

That's my disclaimer.

And.

I want to just jump right in and a
really important part of this program is

fasting.

Twenty one day fast

so i guess the first question.

You know when you

when you tell someone they
have to fast for twenty one days.

That probably gonna.

Freak out

so.

How how is it possible that you
can fast for twenty one days i mean.

I mean aren't you going
to starve to death like what

how would you

respond to that question.

Well first

it's important to know
that i didn't jump into.

Into some guy nuff woo hoo e p.

Treatment.

I was followed by it by my oncologist
both in France and in the u s all the time

and i made my research

and you don't want to bet
my life on someone told me

well yeah you know you should
fast when you have cancer

so i read all the
scientific literature.

I rent all of doctor domestic friends or
research doctor wanted was the longest suit

your research

and at some point.

I discovered your video

which

and i'm very i'm being very honest
with it's really really really helped me.

And but yeah i made
the research and the the

twenty one day.

Water fast.

Seems to be

some kind of a of a of a.

Perfect time

to to help with cancer.

And the

like we discussed
in the previous video.

And

i'm completely aware that i was
in the perfect condition to do that

and everybody needs to make his own research
to adapt to his own lifestyle level of

stress weight

talk to your doctor

does a lot of things i mean
don't just do what i did.

What i'm trying to do
huh and i talked to you

doctor burden unto
your enter your members

and is simply to share
my experience and tell you.

There is a possibility to do something
else or to add something to your treatment

there there's some research that you can
do that that's what i'm trying to do do.

And as far as the twenty
one day fast whites

it's very easy you
know you all know now

following dr berg's the
principle of pathology.

Which is basically when
you're healthy sales has nothing

have nothing to eat.

Instead of dying of hunger.

They will feed

on your non healthy

cells

so basically the
healthy cells will

will

eat

literally eat the cancer cells

and that's that's
the reason why.

Fasting is so powerful
when you have cancer

and that's what i did.

And.

Twenty one days not fun
and like i said the other day

if i were to do it today
i would probably fail

because i don't have.

The a good reason

to do it even though
fasting is always healthy

but when when someone tells you
you're probably going to die you know

and all the research seemed to.

Indicate that if you fast
this is not going to happen.

You just do it

you know it's not the
it's not even a question.

So that's why.

It was not.

That

hard

but was i weak

was i tired yes of course.

Did i spend most of
my twenty one days

lying down on my bed

yeah

absolutely.

Did i lose weight

yeah.

That too.

Did i feel great no

absolutely not

but.

It worked.

After i had my first mri before
and on my second a mri after

the twenty one day fast

and the results were here that
schumer went from ten centimeters to five.

You know.

When you're dealing with
a life or death situation.

Mostly apple will do
whatever they can.

And it also requires fasting
and the thing about fasting

is what you guys need
to know as it's the most

important thing you can do
because of all the different.

Things that kick in

from a genetic level

to hormone level like the
growth hormones go down

and

the cancer cells.

Start committing
suicide because.

When you don't

eat your body goes in
this hyper survival mode.

And.

And it starts to survey vibe better and so
you get all the cancer genes that turn off

and then.

Your your cells actually

recycle.

The cancer cells for food.

So that's a great.

Great thing to be able to turn your cancer
cells into food for your normal cells that.

I mean there's just so much
research on this and i think.

It's important to.

Do.

Not just blindly follow
anyone to really get the data

study it

and unfortunately

there's a lot of big.

Terminal term new terms

when you read the research
so you're going to have to get.

Several dictionaries out you're going
to have to get a medical dictionary

and you're going to have to
understand some of these 'em.

The study so you can have
the confidence to know that.

You know

it can it can work for you.

And

you are you are so right when you say that
because one of the first thing that i did.

When i learned
that i had cancer.

Was to educate myself.

What is cancer what
do we know about it.

And the

one of the thing that i
always tell people is.

My shield from cancer
by trusting the science

and not the doctors.

And i'm not.

Throwing a stone at
the doctors not at all

but.

Not everybody's up to date
with the the latest research

and when you start reading.

Twenty twenty two
twenty twenty one.

Two thousand

all those latest

research on cancer and fasting and
cancer and a ketogenic diet and genser as a

metabolic disease.

You learn so much that.

You're.

Or at least my oncologist
didn't fill me up.

So.

Getting educated and taking
your health into your own hands.

Is the key to
whatever i did and that

the only thing that i
will recommend people.

Yeah i mean.

In a thumbnail sketch of the
way you solve problems is by.

Understanding.

The problem more.

That always seemed
to solve any problem i.

Okay so now

i.

Did you have you didn't really have a lot
of weight to lose when you did this right

so you did get skinny

and you went from
what weight to what way.

I went from seventy
kilos to forty nine kilos

okay.

So.

Sorry i don't know what it is in pounds
but basically i i went from a very healthy

and fit.

Body composition
to nothing but bones.

Okay.

As far as.

During the fasting period

and.

We're not oh let's not talk
about the supplements first but.

What about did you have

anything you had did you have
coffee you didn't you take water

was there anything juices
that you have anything

to eat.

So that's one of the.

Number one question and

i received

from.

From the people is what did you
eat during your twenty one day fast

and the answer is nothing.

It was nuts

it was not intermittent fasting and
people really have to make the difference.

It was not a juice
fast or a raw food fast.

It was a fast

period so i didn't eat anything

in twenty one days.

I mostly had water.

And i was supposed to drink.

One little shop

of wheatgrass
juice freshly pressed

wheatgrass juice every day

which i didn't because.

It tastes horrible.

Until

and here again
thank you dr berg.

Until i saw your video on the
your wheatgrass juice powder

which i bought immediately
unchanged my life

and

i'm not getting paid to say
that i have no personal interest

i'm just saying
because it's the truth

and from that moment it was much
easier for me to consume a little bit.

Of wheatgrass juice.

When i needed it.

So basically i dunno maybe

three four times a week.

I would have a little shot

of regress juice

and that was it so water

most of the time

and with pressed juice

once in a while.

That's all i had for
twenty one days.

Okay now let's shift to the supplements
because that's an important question.

For those of you that
are new watching this.

I study.

Myself.

Tighten the bomb

and a lot of you viewers that
are watching right now donated to.

This cancer research
we did in Europe.

With the help of.

Maurice.

Israel who is a professor

and

his his md.

And as a medical doc or as
well as his phd in biochemistry.

A very very smart.

Person who helped
us set up this study.

He found some
fascinating fascinating

and.

Data it.

As far as the weak link of
cancer the achilles heel the

the area where.

It's a really big difference between
a cancer cell and a normal self and.

And without getting into any technical
things there's a there's a door that.

Goes in the cancer that allows

the cancer cells to
make membranes.

And without those membranes

the cancer cell cannot.

Survive

and so this metabolic

enzyme.

Name.

The initials are Scott.

And so

if you could

potentially block this enzyme.

You could starve the
cancer not from fuel

but from.

Its

raw material

it's structure its membrane.

So.

The problem is.

Well.

Most came

not most but a
handful of chemo drugs.

Then it could be most i dunno.

I

actually block Scott.

But they also kill the cancer
and they kill your immune

system and it just
so happens even

a cancer cell itself.

Is and.

Has some of your own
immune cells in the cancer

tumor itself or the

cancer.

So in other words 'em.

We wanted to find a natural way to block
Scott without the t toxic effect destroying

your immune system.

Well

and.

He did some.

Previous research and
he found great success

so what we did is we

do.

Did.

That research and
we compared it to.

One of the most

powerful chemo drugs
to see how it compared.

Andor.

I did very well

i did a summary of that.

That steady I'll put
that link down below.

But anyway there are certain
nutrients that can block this enzyme

to

potentially close the door on.

The reproduction of the cancer.

Cell and then you took.

Like the two

the two big ones

are Alpha lipoic acid

and a

garcinia cambogia

so you sir tell us a
little bit about Tom

the supplements that you took.

Cause i know there isn't a lot
of extra things you took as well.

Yeah absolutely

and.

Please forgive me if i if i.

Use.

A little

of notes.

Because i don't want to
forget any thing for your.

For your followers.

All the things that i
that i put in my book.

Helps me with the timeline and remembering
what i did when he goes as you can imagine

i was.

My rain was.

Pretty much frozen when
they told me i had cancer and

and.

I had

big

chances to die.

So.

Sometimes i don't remember what i
did when it gets a little confusing so

i take my own book
and i and i take a look.

So basically yes what i did was the
twenty one day fast then strict ketogenic

diet

one hundred percent organic

and

the supplements.

So the supplements just to make sure i
don't forget anything i'm going to i'm going

to read my own book and
and take a look at it the view.

If you allow me.

Man so basically
this is what i did.

I used.

Vitamin d three.

Vitamin c.

Turmeric.

Zinc.

Omega threes.

In the form of fish oil

and in the form of d h eight.

Then i also used.

The famous and

metabolic.

Treatments that you
just mentioned from.

From professor moyes Israel.

Which is made of
Alpha-lipoic acid.

Garcinia Cambodia.

Garlic.

Or garlic extract.

What else but

bu.

Oh yes and.

Melatonin.

Is a new one

high doses of Melatonin in my case it was
anywhere between twenty and thirty grams.

And.

Drama Lane.

And i think that's about it.

So.

Much i hadn't.

Yet got much a green
tea matcha green tea yeah

okay so those are the
supplements that i used.

Great and will put those
down in the description but

but the the big thing that.

I wanted to sir

just mentioned will briefly.

Do.

Some of the like Melatonin.

Also.

Allison from the garlic.

And.

Are also

Scott inhibitors so

there's actually

many Scott and Harrison

and that is the next
thing we're looking at is to.

Take all these natural
Scott inhibitors and.

Evaluate which ones
are the strongest to the.

The weakest and

but.

You know at this point.

We haven't done that
test so we're going to

include

quite a few of the inhibitors

and Melatonin is another.

Potent.

Compound for cancer and of
course so is garlic and so as green tea

green tea.

Also blocks.

The.

Cancer from consuming.

Glutamine.

Which is very very awesome
but it does other things too so.

So in other words Maurice Israel looked
at the camera the the whole biochemistry of

what happens

in cancer.

And he really studied what things need
to be blocked in what we could use to help.

Block.

From going the front and
the back and the back door

i'm telling you these these
cancer cells are really sneaky

so you have to use strategies

to.

Handle this problem
from all angles

so.

So you took these
natural remedies.

And

you also

i think you add sea salt to
write because that's input rd

and

some of the other vitamins you
took because you're not eating food.

You're going to have to
take these vitamins because.

Your health depends on it so.

You didn't eat food but
you had nutrients which

are not going to break the fast and what
we're trying to do here because they're.

Providing something that you're
really missing when you're not eating.

Yeah

so on my side

it was

it was a.

Hard decision.

As to.

Do i take my supplements
when i'm fasting or not

and.

I was gonna

and that's why i suggest
people do and guy

as you know did it

but me my empty
stomach couldn't take.

The vitamins and mineral
supplements when i was fasting

so no i didn't take anything.

For the twenty one days

and i started supplementing after the fast
but it's not what i recommended because i

have a very sensitive stomach

and i just couldn't

i took one bite them in
with a little bit of water and

two minutes later
my stomach hurt.

But yeah usually.

Married

marries his royal anniston.

I

suggest that you keep
taking those supplements

as

your fasting definitely.

The omega three fatty acids are.

Composed of d h a
and e pa those are.

Fish oils and

those are really really
really important as well and.

Especially for.

Their anti cancer so

of course everything.

That you mentioned is.

Has

other additional anti cancer properties like
the turmeric for example and rumbling so

and.

I think.

You you

you're just basically hitting it from a
lotta different angles because you did the

research and you found wow this.

This could work.

Yes absolutely so first.

My oncologist friend in Paris.

Who is aware of.

Morrissey's around in
his work and at the time.

Lol Schwartz's work.

Told me okay Fred
you gotta start taking.

Melatonin Melatonin right away

high doses of Melatonin
you have to start taking.

A green tea thinking.

Garlic

so he was aware of
the of the protocol which

was not as complete
as the time as it is now.

And then a little bit later.

I discovered read.

Through your channel
and and a common friend

guy i.

Contacted him

and got the whole the full protocol
and that's that's how i continued.

My.

My treatment so to speak.

Okay.

So then when you

ate

okay so you went twenty

will first of all like how many.

You you had four months right so did you
start off with a twenty one day faster what

did you

what type of fasting

and i think he was even for five days
not on the rican so just kind of explain.

The details on that so so.

When i was nine diagnosed.

I was really really down completely
frozen i couldn't make any decision

just thinking i was going
to die for three days.

And after the three days

i kicked myself in the
bud then i said okay.

I'm going to survive this i'm going to
do whatever it takes but i'm going to

survivors and that's where
i started doing my research

so almost immediately i went

on a strict

twenty one day fast water fast.

After that.

I went on a strict organic

ketogenic diet then we can go
through what i ate if you want to.

And for three months

and almost at the end

i didn't know i was almost cure and the
time we just knew that the tumor was getting

smaller and smaller
but he was still here.

I went for another

twenty one day fast

but only fasting
five days a week

and eating normally

a normal ketogenic diet

during the weekends.

And so.

The goal that is so you started
with a twenty one day fast.

Then you went to

one meal a day

and then you went back to.

A twenty one days
of really like five.

Days of fasting and then
two days of one meal a day.

Exactly the tone.

Okay yes.

And okay so then

when you did eat.

Coming off of the twenty
one day fast of course

you had to gradually
introduce food right.

Yes

so let's

talk about what how did you gradually
injured his food what did you eat.

What first i was on a strict
ketogenic diet so zero zero carbs

or as close to zero as i could.

No sugar not even fruits

and.

Basically i was left with
proteins fats and veggies

so i tried

and i went on a.

On a on a quest almost discover
what can i eat and why couldn't

and most of what i ate.

Get me so much pain i was in so much
pain at the time because of the cancer.

So the only thing i could eat and i
discovered that throughout several days.

Was.

Freshly pressed

vegetable juice.

Beef.

One hundred percent
grass fed grass finished beef

and mostly revise which.

For me was the perfect balance of
not too much protein and enough fat.

And good fats avocado.

Coconut oil.

Grass fed butter.

French heavy cream.

That's all i could eat it

sold for three and a half month

all i ate was.

Vegetable juice

and ribeye steak.

The next David devil juice and ribeye steak
and the day after that vegetable juice

and ribeye steaks
that's what i ate.

And.

Again or one of your video really
helped me because when i discovered

that glutamine could
also feed cancer.

In in in certain conditions.

But that green tea.

Could help her that's

what i did was.

Break my fast every day
with a fresh vegetable juice.

Then.

About an hour later

had my steak and avocado

and about.

Five to ten minutes after that.

A big.

Glass of green tea

to help control roll

the glutamine from the stake

and that was my meal

every single day

for almost three months.

Okay.

Good so that helps out

and

and then.

As far as quantity of what you

did you just pretty
much eat enough.

So you can be filled

because your
stomach when fasting

kind of shrinks since you're not able to
probably the quantities that you normally.

Well.

I can eat

the mother or that i can eat so

before cancer.

If i had

if i had pizza for example i wouldn't have
wanted i wouldn't have two bids as i have

for pizza

i can eat.

Of course i couldn't eat the same thing and
not in the same quantity when i was sick

but.

At least

a one pound

ribeye

it was my.

Basic

quantity.

Once a day.

Yet once a day.

A big glass of fresh
seasonal vegetables.

A big

one one pound
ribeye cooked in butter

or olive oil with a pinch in

a

Milan salt

or sea salt.

And migrant he.

Does basically
what i ate every day

and what to do what type
of i supposed to do juice.

Anything

anything that was

organic

and in season.

So

during the summer
i juiced a ladder for

a spinach and cabbage
and stuff like that.

During the winter.

When we went more into the
spring i just cucumbers and celery

so it really i just
took whatever.

The farmers market
was offering me.

At that particular time.

But as many veggies as possible

drains

colored.

To have as much micronutrients
as i could that was my goal

to really.

Push.

The micro nutrition into my body

and to help my body
fight that cancer.

There are so many things so many anti
cancer every time you look up the benefit of

any vegetable even beets
and carrots and everything.

It they will always say
to them any accident has.

It

has anti-inflammatory
anti cancer.

Properties.

But i think also you had

a cruciferous vegetables too right oh
yes glorious a lot of a lot of broccoli is

and the two have
even more effect

i used a lot

i juiced a lot of
broccoli sprouts.

So.

I put the sprouts

in neiges

in the in the juicer i'm in.

And the just extract

the nutrients from
the broccoli sprouts

and yeah

that was.

Mainly.

All my juices.

All my juices in addition
to the seasonal vegetable

i always added

broccoli sprouts

and turmeric

those are the two
things that were

that were here in NY juice.

Year round all the time.

That's powerful
powerful anti cancer

and.

Like now.

Going

now

present

to present time

what do you normally eat now.

So i tried to stay on
a one meal a day.

Intermittent fasting protocol

but not always

if i work out a lot or just if i'm
hungry I'll have two meals a day.

In it.

In a six hour window

so i still spend a lot of
the day and night of course

fasting.

And as far as food.

Now.

I can have pretty much
any kind of proteins.

And

eggs

no problem.

Chicken.

Fish.

Beef of course.

So and any kind of
animal protein is fine.

I'm still having a hard time with
whole veggies because the fibers.

Still.

Irritates

my my investments
so i still juice my that

is.

The main difference.

Is the sugar.

So.

I eat.

A little bit of sugar

in the form of fruits

and once in a while

in the form of raw honey.

And.

It is something that i didn't
allow myself at all when i was sick.

I am not convinced one
hundred per cent that.

The fructose the
sugar of the fruits.

In it's original foot
mattress which is the whole

truth.

Is really bad for cancer i dunno

but because i didn't know.

I preferred not had

any sugar at all when i was sick

but not in a not sick anymore and i have
zero trace of cancer than older cancer and

inflammatory markers are good.

I have fruits.

On my non workout days

so on my workout days i do more.

Of the

proteins and fats

and on my non

workout days

i do less fat and
a little bit the fruits.

Of course

organic and seasonal

so that's the main difference
with what i didn't before

so my diet is
basically the same.

As far as micronutrients.

A little bit more
variety with the proteins

and a little bit of fruits.

Three times a week.

Got it.

Do you.

Do

you currently take any
probiotics were from

fermented type foods.

Yes i use a Sauerkraut

a lot.

A lot.

A little bit of Sauerkraut.

Almost every day.

So that's so key for your your
gut in the mic since you had.

It was in your digestive system so might
as well support that and that you couldn't

get a better food
than Sauerkraut.

Yeah Sauerkraut is
really one of the thing

that's not on the i
like so it's not it's not.

An effort for me to eat it

and and it's soup for
super powerful as far as as

a pro and prebiotics
so i'm amusing it's.

Quite

often.

Fantastic.

Now i want to bring up another
really really important point and

so if anyone checked
out check back in right

now because this
part is really important.

Before you got cancer
and your diet wasn't that bad

in fact you're.

Doing it

fasting you you're doing.

Keto

the healthy version
for a period of time.

Wish.

It was.

I asked you a question.

What was your stress level and
your stress was off the roof and

and so.

When you do with.

Cancer and.

There are things in a smoking can
cause cancer chemicals cause cancer.

Chronic.

Anything can cause.

Cancer

and bad foods
and things like that.

But.

People don't really.

Put all attention on
the stress factor too so

a stress factor can activate.

Your genetics to.

Turn things in.

A bad way you

can turn things on that

should be turned off so you
went through stress that i think.

Because of the whole
pandemic thing you

couldn't.

You couldn't have your

you had

different doge jazz around the
country that closed down right.

Yes.

Yes absolutely and and

went.

There's a lot of different stresses and
and that's what people don't understand.

I didn't have

what most people would
call a very stressful life

i mean i didn't battle

with

my family i didn't
battle at work i didn't

i didn't have
that kind of stress

and.

Your rights when you said
at my life i was pretty good.

I tried to eat
organic for the past.

I dunno twenty

twenty five years.

I was on keto for
quite a long time.

What else always active

and doing a lot of
meditation are a lot of tai chi.

My martial arts boxing parkour

crossfit

so as i was an active person.

And

doing intermittent
fasting for twenty years.

And.

So people asked me so how come

you did all that and got cancer

and you did all
that and get cured.

And.

I think

i'm not sure but i think it's
the compounding of everything

it's putting everything together

all the time.

And as face trust.

Yes

the

dependent make.

And and the the world
situation stops me from doing

a big part of my

professional activity.

I usually travel the world to to go and
teach in all my nitro Joe's around the world

night

my martial arts goals

i couldn't do that.

It's complicated as far as.

Finance.

And of course that
was a big stressor.

And thats when

the cancer appeared

i also had

a genetic predisposition because
apparently from what the doctor told me.

It was one of the few real

genetic.

Cancer

so my food and my
lifestyle was not so much.

The the the guilty parties there

but to my genetic background was

the sleeping cause as i call it

but distress

was the trigger

that there's no doubt yeah.

And i try my best when i
was trying to heal myself

to compound everything that i knew about
fasting and diet and stuff like that plus

all my new research.

Was with.

Even less stress in my life
you know more breathing more.

Walking out in nature more.

Meditation and stuff
like that then i think it's a

it's a combination
of all the things.

We said last time
on the last video that.

Cancer is multifactorial

but healing cancer

is also multifactorial
and i did a lot of things.

If you add to everything
that we talked about

the ice cold bath.

The breathing

and the walk in nature.

Playing with my dog playing
with my wife having fun laughing.

Watching it nothing
but comedies.

All those things.

I believe participated
to my healing.

You know.

He brought up a good point like you
had to you have to step up your discipline

to to.

To get an ice cold ass i mean for example
fasting for twenty one days that's all

requires a lot of discipline

and you know.

I think come out of necessity.

You understanding.

What needs to be done because
now you did the research.

Out of necessity you pulled it out of yourself
and you're able to kind of stick to it

because you're probably
willing to do whatever it took.

To survive basically

yes

yes absolutely

and the.

Some people say abbott is probably because
of your martial arts training you have

more discipline than others.

It might be true

but look at gaia

our friend guy

who is.

Who was seventy

at the time of his cancer

and

no discipline whatsoever
never breakfast any martial arts.

Overweight

cancer stage four

and diabetes

everything you
could have he had it

and he did the same thing

as me he did the fat
thing he did the keto

and and

he cured himself

so.

Like you said out of necessity

when your life is on the line
i think it's much much easier

than when

you just.

Randomly decide to do a
fast or randomly decide to

to

as as as a prevention to
take care of your health.

And don't get me wrong
prevention is critical

and it's much better much
easier than finding a cancer

but.

But

it's harder

it's hot too fast.

When.

When you don't have.

A.

Very very high motivation
such as eight you're gonna die.

You know

people that are watching
this video right now are.

Either potentially have cancer.

They're interested in
preventing cancer that

might have friends or
family that have cancer

but if cancer is
not on your radar.

Because you're not.

You don't have
any awareness of it

it'll never happen to me even
though it's the number one second.

Or the second.

Killer

world.

And.

You probably won't be
interested in cancer until you.

Have you to someone
close to you or yourself

can you start developing
cancer and then.

You become very
interested in it.

So.

It wasn't i wasn't into health

at all until i had probably my

late twenties.

Because i personally was
affected negatively with my health

other people

they seemed to
get by and they can.

They don't have any problems until
later in life and then they they make this

shift and change.

So.

My whole thing is awesome.

You can.

Acquire

a tremendous amount of

survival knowledge by
learning from other people's.

Stories.

Others people's success

successful actions other
people's strategies and.

I dunno if.

When you're watching
this you realize how.

Vital

and Fred is

giving us this

this really key is these keys
are these strategies because.

It can come in handy if
you have your kid cancer.

Wherever you have someone
going through cancer this is like.

Superior information
that you should.

Use

and apply and think with

and.

Cause there's nothing worse than getting
cancer and not having any of this data could

you imagine like.

Getting cancer

not having all these insights

and you just falling mainstream.

Which

you're you know you pray i
dunno if you'd be alive by now.

Yet

absolutely

and you know
we're so lucky to live.

In the times we're living
because imagine my situation

without the Internet

a right.

Right

what would i have
done i mean nothing.

Right.

Right.

That's right so.

So again it comes down to.

Being able to.

Somehow with your awareness.

Pull out the right
information that makes

sense to you because there's
so much confusion out there

and unfortunately

and.

The first

five to ten pages of Google has.

What the what
everyone's doing and i

i think with the thing that
helped me mostly as a

i'm always skeptical of what everyone
else is doing or everyone thinks is true.

It's usually the opposite.

Especially when you get into the
single everyone knows yeah well

who's everyone and
where did that come from so.

I suspect that i.

I tend to do.

Everything the opposite and
it seems to be very successful.

Very successful.

I remember

i think it was one of your
videos when you said you have.

I don't remember what he was i think it was
about diabetes if you have diabetes go on

the website of the American diabetes
association and do the complete opposite then

you have a better chance.

I apologize if it's someone
else i don't remember

but i thought that was brilliant

and that's basically what i did

he doesn't mean that
i completely rejected.

Western medicine

or that i have a grudge
against against it.

I just didn't think it
was the answer for me

but

as we discussed last time

i

i did.

Three sessions of chemo.

Because of the pain and it
really helped me so i'm thankful

to to those doctors

and

nurse.

Who who are helping with the
symptoms and it is critical when you.

When you soft when
you suffer so much that.

You don't

you're not even sure
that you want to leave.

And thats where i
was at some point.

And a doctor tells you hair.

Take my chemo take my feeling you're
going to feel better in in three weeks.

It's a miracle

and i and i really appreciated
and i thank my doctor for that

but.

As far as curing me

without any long
term side effects.

For me.

Western medicine was not the answer
and i choose to look at the biology

and the and the and the science

instead of the medicine

but he doesn't mean it's the same truth for
anyone everybody has to make his research

and and put.

His or her trust.

Into what feels right

for for for that person.

When you deal with cancer
there's a lot of conflicting

information so you have.

A lot of

so called facts that are

opposing each
other you can't have.

Two facts opposing each
other one of them has to be.

False

and so you you unfortunately
going to have to study both

viewpoints.

Back and forth to really see which
one is true and which ones are false but

when you deal with cancer
there's a lot of money going on

and there's a lot of corruption.

There's a lot of them.

False information
manipulation of research.

So.

There's a.

There's a really good book
i'm gonna put a down below

of them.

Some one really

highly credible scientists who.

Talked about all the manipulation that
they do in cancer research and i think.

If you're

really.

Interested you should take
a look at that book because

you need to know

the truth

and.

And that way you can em.

You know not be susceptible
to doing the wrong thing.

One of the thing that i did when i
was doing my research and it's.

Just it was my main philosophy.

It's not always true but i was my
main line to select information is

when you have two conflicting

informations about
the exact same thing.

First.

Trust the one that
doesn't make money.

Like you're fasting.

Trusting doesn't make
anyone any money

so studied at first it
doesn't mean it's the truth.

Keep studying.

All possibilities

but my first attention

would be on those.

Research and from researchers
that didn't make money out of it.

That was my first to
my first main idea.

Yet unfortunately others

researches.

They get paid they're
they're funded by

industry and.

Governments and
things like that so

i mean who's going to
pay a researcher to do.

Research on somebody
doesn't make money it's it's

it's hard to.

There's so many things like

that is why you're not going
to find a lot of research in.

Apple cider vinegar for example
because some it's just not.

Not a product that people buy.

So anyway Fred this
has been an incredible.

Knowledge.

Talk.

Dialogue that we had i think
people are going to really.

Use this data to
survive better and.

I'll put some down some
links if he hadn't saw.

If he had

not seen the other videos that we've done
are related to this topic so you can have

all information so.

Thank you very much read.

I appreciate you my pleasure

thank you.
